		<ul>
			<li>We found older lib performs much better. Rollbacked Async HTTP Client to 1.65, netty to v3.25 for 30%+ reduced CPU usage and 30%+ speed boost. </li>
			
		</ul>

		<br/><h4>Jan 08, 2015 </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Optimize ad-hoc request initialization logic. </li>
			
		</ul>

		<br/><h4>March 17, 2014 </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Add/Fix check on time zone plus in log. Duo to the URL encoding issues with PLUS sign. Currently only supports MINUS time zones (If +0800 will result in ERRORs. Currently Good: -??00). Defined in applicaiton.conf : agentmaster.var.LOG_TIME_ZONE=America/New_York</li>
		</ul>


		<br/><h4>January 28, 2014 </h4>
		<ul>
			
			<li>Rebranding. Change node group related to restsuperman. NOTICE - NEW NAME, SAME CODE and SCALABILITY: We would like a minor change on the name. The project name is now changed to REST Commander. We will ensure a smooth transition. No worry, all the code and functions will remain the same. 2014/01/23</li>
